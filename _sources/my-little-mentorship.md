# My little mentorship

Helping each other is magic, you can also do it.

At eurucamp 2014, we ran an unconditional mentorship program. eurucamp 2015 continued that tradition. I always promised a writeup and wanted to encourage people to run their own. Sadly, I never found it to be in a state to be publishable, especially the tutorial part.

Soo, this is a dump of all the bits and pieces I dig out while doing it again for Rustfest that you can assemble on your own. Comes time, comes more structure.

### The validation email

Hi,

you are receiving this email because we intent to assign you as a mentor for a eurucamp speaker.

We're very grateful that you provide your time for this!

Given that you probably ticked that box 2 month ago, could you please quickly reply with YES/NO if this is still okay for you?

Best,
$yourself

### The email a speaker receives

Hi $speaker,

Thank you again for speaking at this years eurucamp! As per this years unconditional mentorship program[1], you will have a mentor assigned.

We are lucky to have a 1 on 1 match for mentors and speakers. Your assigned mentor is: $mentor $mentor_email

Here are a few hints and guides for your relationship:

Value your mentors time. If possible, sketch out a timeline for your preparations early. A good first step is to send an initial email to your mentor and present the topic of your talk. Just including your proposal and arranging a date to discuss is a good start.

Ask actively. The mentor should not have to check on you regularly. If any question pops up, send an email immediately to allow time for the response. Admit if you are blocked on something. "I am stuck and have problem to go on" is a perfect example on what a mentor is there for. Also, if there is something that you are comfortable with and don't think you need help, make that clear.

Your Mentor does not have to be your only resource. Read up on things and discuss findings with your mentor.

Before the conference, try to arrange a rehearsal. If you need a room in Berlin, let us know. Collect post-talk feedback, especially from your mentor.

If you and your mentor disagree and you cannot find a solution, always remember: this is _your_ talk.

Please note that the eurucamp audience consists of an usual high rate of new developers, making a pass through your talk and finding ways to make it accessible for this crowd is highly appreciated.

If there are any questions, please get to in touch with us.

We are looking forward to your talk!

Best,
Florian and the eurucamp team

### The email a mentor receives

Hi $mentor,

Thank you again for taking part in our Mentorship Program.

Your assigned speaker is: $speaker

_A description of the talk from the program commitees point of view and where they see points that can be problematic or things that are hard to cover_

To make sure everything works well, here are a few pointers:

You should support the speakers in bringing their topic on stage. If you feel like you cannot support the speaker - for example, because you feel strongly conflicted about the topic of the talk - please let us know and we can assign another mentor. Your main job is being the person the speaker can turn to if questions arise.

You don't need to be the only one. Motivate speakers to validate their talk with other people and help them finding those. This is especially important if you live across time zones and setting up meeting for speaking about the talk is hard. Encourage them to validate their talk early.

If the speaker is experienced, don't try to forcefully go through things they are comfortable with.

Meeting early and setting a timeline will especially help new speakers. If you mentor a seasoned speaker, they might have their own pace of working that you shouldn't disrupt except if if is identified as an issue. It is still their talk ;).

Be clear about what you can and cannot do. If you are a busy person, make it clear that responses might take some time and that should be accounted for.

Before the conference, try to arrange a rehearsal. If you need a room in Berlin, let us know. Make sure someone (preferrably you) actually watches the talk, takes notes and provides good feedback afterwards.

If there are any questions, please get to touch with us.

Best,
Florian and the eurucamp team
