# Wordsmithing

I'm caring about and working on my language, especially because I consider it one
of my base skills that I always want to become better at.

I'll document a couple of aspects here. Consider this a bunch of personal notes
that I don't really want to discuss, but I'm always happy about information and
maybe someone finds some gems here and there.
