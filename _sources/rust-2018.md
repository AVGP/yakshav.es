# 2018: The year we learn Rust 1.0

**THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNFINISHED DRAFT**

This is my reply to Rusts [call for community blog posts](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html).

I'm known for being quite happy with Rust as is. Indeed, [my first post on being more conservative with Rust](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/please-avoid-the-cookie-jar/2109) was more then 2 years ago ;).

Also, note that I've been interested (and practically involved) in the growing and adoption of programming languages since around 2004, which was when I started doing users support for Ruby in Germany.

## Background

I am of the opinion that programming languages are never fully understood, neither by their users, nor their creators. What may seem a hard problem yesterday suddenly gets solved by a standard practice tomorrow, without any changes to the language.

I'll give an example: which language do you think of when I say "duck-typing"? Probably Ruby.[1] That wasn't always the case. Indeed, Ruby was already quite an old language when it got introduced as a strategy: [in Ruby 1.8.0](https://viewsourcecode.org/why/hacking/rubyOneEightOh.html), that was almost 10 years in. Later came software like Rails, Sinatra, Merb, DataMapper or, nowadays rom-rb. All these projects have something in common: they invented new ways to work with the language. None of them changed the language. The legendary "instabilty" of the JavaScript world? All people inventing new approaches. This is for a very loose definition of "inventing", most inventions in the programming world are someone porting an existing concept and making it approachable. Rust in itself is no different.

I've seen more then one language designer taking hasty notes during a conf talk because someone was doing _something_ with their language that they didn't know was possible.

Programming languages are so complex that they constantly give new possibilities to combine their features in new ways without changing them. That also makes discussing them so hard and prone to talk past each other, because everyone has a very different way of viewing them. For example, I tend to not give so much about small details in code and am very fine with boilerplate. Systems construction is my interested.

I also am of the opinion that language adoption far more about connection points then about many small qualities of the language. I think, for example, that JavaScripts current position in the programming world is entirely understandable and to a large extend rational. Haters disagree.

## We can't Rust

With that background, I'd like to say that we don't understand Rust to some point. We don't even understand Rust 1.0. For example, all the techniques in [Pascals great API patterns guide](https://deterministic.space/elegant-apis-in-rust.html) are possible since forever. All of them took someone a while to properly figure out. This document could not have been written on April 15, 2015. My major sport for 2015 was finding libraries that were relying on nightly features and teaching people how to do that with stable Rust at no cost.

This isn't a complaint, it's the joy of working with a programming language, especially a new one. And we tend to forget that Rust is a damn good programming language. I'm also not saying that we shouldn't continue to evolve the language, for example the addition of custom derives in Rust 1.15.0 was extremely important and helping a lot.

But still, I think, we should start working with the Rust we have and use this year to push this good language into the world.

## I'd like us to stabilise imperfect things

Because we can't Rust, we currently can't produce solutions that will surely stand the test of time. That's fine.

There's more then a couple of things missing in the Rust world that are slowly becoming serious issues: for example, we _still_ don't have a stable,properly documented HTTP client (not even as a binding, mind you). This is also strengthened by fundamental libraries for those tasks being notoriously unstable, too: notably `futures` and `tokio`. This has huge repercussions to the whole ecosystem: especially `futures` usually describes public interface of your library. Breakage of futures is breakage of your interface.

All of the mentioned libraries are interesting in their own right. Indeed, you can learn quite a lot about API building from them. Hyper is a great example of how to use Rust fundamentals (plain ownership and borrowing) to great effect. But sadly, all of them are not properly documented or are even up for [yet another big rebuild](https://github.com/aturon/tokio-rfcs/blob/tokio-reform/tokio-reform.md). I see a lot of good plans there, but they don't fix the biggest problem: lacking stable availability. Because of that, all these subjects are still considered "advanced Rust", without good reason to.

With all respect to authors of many fundamental libraries: 1.0 isn't the end of the world. Many libraries are in a great shape. A 2.0 is possible. The Rust world would vastly benefit from a 1.0 and proper documentation.

## More competition

We should find more ways of doing things. Are `futures` really the best implementation for this? Maybe we can provide alternative ideas for the same concepts.

## More high level documentation

One of the reasons I like using `futures`, `tokio` and `hyper` as examples is because I learned so much from them. They all found and implement very interesting patterns to work with the language. Sadly, these gems are still hidden in those libraries.

## Let's learn constructing Rust programs

A final thing that is almost not covered is how to construct and build large programs.
