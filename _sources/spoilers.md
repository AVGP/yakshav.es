# Spoilers

I don't care about spoilers, be it for video games or movies. I'm quite happy
to have them and I think good discussions about both need to discuss
specifics of story and especially twists. I generally ask before doing so,
but as this is no conversation, but my personal space, I'll just write whatever
I want. Heed the warning.

On top of that, I'm heavily reliant on spoilers in certain aspects and generally
read up on movies before seeing them. There's not a lot of resources for that.
