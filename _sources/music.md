# Music

I like music a lot, but I never come around to write about it.

There's currently a Twitter account I'm experimenting with,
[anspielung](https://twitter.com/anspielung), which has some music
I'm listening to, from time to time.

Maybe, I'll use this shave to dig into the topic a little more.

I like music recommendations and am currently searching for
of spoken work stuff. Take Little Simz and Kate Tempest as an
illustration for what I am into.
