# Sponsor Skade

I'm seeking personal sponsorship. For detailed reasoning, see [Sustainabilty]().

To help out, [get in touch](mailto:info@asquera.de).

## From whom?

I am interested corporate and company donors of any size.

I'm also fine with conferences and can even offer consulting in return. I don't do diversity consulting.

## How much?

I'm seeking at least EUR 15.000 for 2018, either as one-off payments or monthly. I prefer to accept your sponsorship through my company, [Asquera](). We can also negotiate other forms.

If that goal is hit, I may think about using this money otherwise.

To help out, [get in touch](mailto:info@asquera.de).

## What does this money buy?

Mainly Time. I'm currently involved and/or helping the following projects:

* Rust Berlin
* Rust project global community team
  - answering community requests
  - events team lead
  - content team contributor
  - On-site person at community events
* The Rust YouTube account
* RustFest
* helping out Rust LATAM
* impl days
* Ruby Berlin e.V.
* OpenTechSchool e.V.
* Mozilla TechSpeakers
* IsleOfRuby
* RubyOnIce

Currently, most of this work happens on evenings. Your support would also allow me to refocus on non-Rust things again.

Beyond that, I have a lot of experience that I would like to spread/write down:
* How to plan and run affortable conferences, especially around budgeting
* How to run fair and diverse conferences
* How to interact with conferences
* Approaches to community development
* Writing proposals and speaker mentoring

One of those projects is the [FOSS events planner](https://github.com/rust-community/foss-events-planner/). It's under the umbrella of the Rust project, but open to all.

## What is this sponsorship not for?

Personal expenses and travel, especially speaking expenses. These are either paid by conferences I speak at or through other means.

## What will I provide?

A regular writeup and worklog of things done, at least once a month. Also, I'll present all sponsors on this website and give you thanks :).
