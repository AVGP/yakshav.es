# So much space

I have recently been a bit floating when it comes to Rusts community work. Not 
because there's something amiss, but because there is seemingly not that much 
amiss. Autopilot on, go. Write a comment here, run a meetup there, RustFest this.

Feedback is great, new events are popping up left and right and some metrics,
we are making faster progress then others. Also, there's not many metrics
at all for the kind of work the Rust community team does.
