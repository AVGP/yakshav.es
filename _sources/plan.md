# Near-future plans

These are my personal near-future plans.

## yakshav.es-related (Tech)

* [ ] Write a small command-line tool for editing shaves - I'd like the edit them whereever I am (on the console)
* [ ] Maybe set up travis building for the whole thing, but that usually makes things more tedious
* [ ] Figure out a nice way to publish pictures
* [ ] Figure out a way to create a feed for the content

## yakshav.es-related (Non-Tech)

* [ ] License stuff
* [ ] Publish a lot of the writing I did for conferences in the recent years (mails, etc.)
* [ ] Describe a few of the things I'm involved in

## Rust related

* [ ] Get ticket sales for @rustfest up and running
* [ ] Get mentorship for @rustfest up and running

## laze.rs

* [ ] At least get basic couchdb interaction working, reading and writing and handling docs
* [ ] Implement the replicator on top of that
