# My mobile working setup

I recently changed my working setup for work. I'd like to document it here.

## Background

I like writing during travelling. I did, in the beginning, use my smartphone together with an Apple bluetooth keyboard and liked that setup for its simplicity. There's not much more to do on the phone then the application currently at hand, it is small and usable.

Back when I first tried it out, application support was horrible though. Because of Apples neglectance of sharing more then files between applications made even managing of work difficult. So I ended up getting my notebook out for most stuff again. Also, the setup always had the problem where to keep the phone...

That has changed with iOS 9 and after tipping my toes in the water again, I decided to try things again and am quite happy with the setup.

## The keyboard

After quite some research, I opted for a [Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard](). The keyboard itself is suprisingly hard to get on short notice.

The keyboard has settings for working as a Windows, Android or iOS keyboard. It is a standard keyboard with some additional keys for locking, volume/audio control, and searching. The build quality is great.

It comes with a rubbery cover that can hold the device you are using while working. The cover is quite heavy at first, but once you start using it, it shows why: it holds rock solid. The rubber effect of the cover also means that the whole setup never moves, neither on a table or your knees.

Microsoft advertises 90 days off standby off one charge and I haven't managed to run out of battery.

## Device: iPad Mini 4

I had bad experiences with the very first iPad and never used a tablet since then. After some back and forth, I still decided to get one instead of using my phone, mostly because of the larger size and seperate battery from my phone.

I opted for not considering an Android device because I already did my applications research and doing it again would have cost me additional effort.

The split screen mode took some getting used to, but I really love it! Most applications I use support it well, making editing a text and working with a git client alongside a matter of sliding to the left.
