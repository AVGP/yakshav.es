# Conference Communication

I wrote quite a lot of things over the years for some of the conferences I ran.

Some people enjoyed it and asked for being able to reuse the texts, but I never
got around to publish them. They never felt finished. Now that there's a space
for unfinished stuff, I'll publish some over the next weeks.
