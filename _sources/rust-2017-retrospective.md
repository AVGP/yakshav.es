# My personal Rust 2017 retrospective

I noticed recently that 2017 was such an active year in Rust for me that
I feel like I want to note stuff down. Especially my community work
rarely leaves lasting artifacts, so noting them down makes is an attempt
to make it.

## Rust Hack & Learn Berlin

Let's start with a downending. Because of my work involvement, I haven't
visited and managed the Rust Hack & Learn Berlin as much as I wanted.

I'll try to do that more this year ;).

## RustFest Kyiv & Zurich

RustFest is growing nicely and I've been involved. Even though I can claim
to have started RustFest, speaking about them in those terms is always hard:
none of them would have worked without the local teams, which all have their
own ways of doing things and are so great at organising stuff.

I was very happy that we could also serve more (geographically) eastern
community with the Kyiv one, travel for large crowds is still an issue.

RustFest teams, you rock!

Off to [Paris](http://paris.rustfest.eu), next!

## MozFest

I helped organising a table at MozFest. Response was great, a lot of people
coming around to ask a lot of things. Basically, 2 days of talking...

## Talks

I've given a couple of talks this year, some of which don't have a video :).

* Mozilla Dev Roadshow Hamburg and Berlin: Rust (20 min)
* [RubyC: Potential (about Community work, touching on Rust work) (40min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUEki-o2ihA)
* HTWG Konstanz: The Rust Community (30 min)
* HTWG Konstanz: Concurrency and Futures (60 min)
* GOTO Nights Berlin: An introduction to Rust (30 min)
* Rust Hungary: An introduction to Rust (20 min planned, 40 min actual)
* [GOTO Berlin: Why is Rust successful? (50 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj8Q12DaEQ)
* Open Source Business Alliance: Rust (5 min)
* Rust Oslo: Why is Rust successful? (50 min)

## Code

Most of my code ended up being experiments on my [GitHub](https://github.com/skade). I'm currently
trying to port [webmachine](https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine) to Rust, under the name of
[Gerust](https://github.com/gerust/gerust), let's see how far that goes.

Two projects I started and want to end over the year are 
[cute](https://github.com/skade/cute), a
small book about futures, implementing a simple executor and ["the memory is 
hot lava"](https://github.com/skade/the-memory-is-hot-lava),
a zero-knowledge introduction into memory using Rust and drawings.

## Professionally

I've grown a small Rust business, giving training. I gave a total of 6 
trainings with 3 days each
over the last year. One of the trainings was an advanced engineer training at 
Mozilla.
Material can be found [here](https://github.com/skade/rust-three-days-course).

## A personal thanks

I've been really happy to work with all the individuals in the Rust team over the last year.

The project from the outside might sometimes feel like a rather homegenous group, but it really
isn't. This might sound weird, but I want to explicitely point out how disagreement and complaints
are handled: open and assertive.
