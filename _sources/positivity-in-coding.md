# Positivity in Coding

Far too much time is spent complaining about how everything is broken and computers suck.

Sometimes, if your problem is 2 programs fighting over handling a file, remember that there's around a million lines of code to just run these two programs, running on around a billion transistors and that both of this programs probably contain at least 1000 decisions.
