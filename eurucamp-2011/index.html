<h1 id="eurucamp-2011">eurucamp 2011</h1>
<p>I had the plan to write down my experiences with eurucamp for a while. eurucamp was one of the central experiences I had in the recent years and each of them is somewhat special.</p>
<p>Of all eurucamps, eurucamp 2011 has the most curious story (and that says something!). Basically, EuRuKo 2011 in Berlin was so successful and quickly sold out that some clever soul found out that it might be possible to run <em>another</em> event just right next to it. That event was eurucamp.</p>
<p>For me, the 2011 edition is a special one, as I only attended as a speaker (I had a ticket for EuRuKo), but gave me a lot</p>
