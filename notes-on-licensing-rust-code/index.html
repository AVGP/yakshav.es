<h1 id="notes-on-licensing-rust-code">Notes on licensing Rust code</h1>
<p>Licensing Rust code has particular issues, mostly that it isnâ€™t C.</p>
<p>This makes recommending licenses particular.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-copyleft-but-only-for-my-library">I want copyleft, but only for my library</h2>
<p>The GPL with linking exception is a better pick here then the LGPL. The problem lies hidden inside the LGPL: it requires that the library must be replacable and the assembled program can be re-linked with a self-written version of it. This requires dynamic linking. Rust usually links statically.</p>
<p>This means, that the LGPL effectively requires you to ship the whole Rust code of the resulting program.</p>
<p>libgit2 solves this by giving you the express permission to link the results to a program in any way you like.</p>
<p>Consider the MPL-2.0 in that case.</p>
