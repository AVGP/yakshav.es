<p>I wrote quite a lot of things over the years for some of the conferences I ran.</p>
<p>Some people enjoyed it and asked for being able to reuse the texts, but I never got around to publish them. They never felt finished. Now that there’s a space for unfinished stuff, I’ll publish some over the next weeks.</p>
