      <p>General notes on my sport of choice.</p>
      <h2 id="summer-geshukku">Summer Geshukku</h2>
      <p>I went to my first Geshukku (basically a three-day training camp) and had a few interesting observations.</p>
      <p>I came there with a certain skill. I had learned to use a bow and sometimes even hit the target quite well. Most of my shots went somehow beyond the target. I started off the first day with two hits. I felt great.</p>
      <p>Then the teacher came, had a look at my technique, and pointed out flaws both in my equipment and my technique. Being an rookie, this didn’t come as a surprise. What came as a surprise was that the corrections Mori gave me were initially incredibly frustrating. My accuracy dropped sharply most of my arrows went far astray. This dragged on for most of the second training day and got extremely frustrating. My shooting had become worse.</p>
      <p>Though getting a little bit better, that also dragged on for the third day. Despite focusing hard on my tasks and also being sure that they were all better then before, the result was worse then before. But suddenly, after taking some time to examine everything again in front of the Makiwara, I returned back to the shooting range to find that suddenly, things had improved. While I’m still obviously a rookie archer, suddenly, arrows were flying towards the mato at much higher accuracy.</p>
      <p>Before, hitting felt like a random event in a few stray shots, after, it felt like a willful act.</p>
      <p>I think the moral in there is that when improving skills for the long term, you need to be prepared for a short-term regression.</p>
