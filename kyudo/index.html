<h1 id="kyūdō">Kyūdō</h1>
<p>General notes on my sport of choice.</p>
<h2 id="kyū-wat">Kyū-Wat?</h2>
<p>Kyūdō is a form of archery that developed in Japan. The bows in use are longbows, around 2m30 in height. Interestingly, the bows are <em>asymmetric</em>, meaning that you hold them in the lower third.</p>
<p>Shooting them requires a rather elaborate technique, as the asymmetric forces working on the arrow need to managed. It is as much about controlling your whole body and concentration as it is about the actual act.</p>
<p>It’s generally practiced in traditional clothing.</p>
<h2 id="particularities">Particularities</h2>
<p>One of the interesting aspects of Kyūdō is that it is literally “the way of the bow” and not necessarily “archery”. That means that you should bring some time.</p>
<p>Depending on the Dojo you are in, it can take around 20-30 training sessions until they hand you a bow - without arrows. Some Dojos accellerate that by having intensive training at the beginning.</p>
<p>This isn’t out of spite, hurting yourself with strong bowstrings is something that can happen. It’s also a good preparation. Kyūdō is about slow and steady improvement, not only of the shooting aspects. There are many aspects that go beyond shooting an arrow down a lane, especially traditional ceremonies that must be trained (and as simple as they look, can be quite exhaustive).</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-the-summer-gasshuku-2016">Notes on the Summer Gasshuku 2016</h2>
<p>I went to my first Geshukku (basically a three-day training camp) and had a few interesting observations.</p>
<p>I came there with a certain skill. I had learned to use a bow and sometimes even hit the target quite well. Most of my shots went somehow beyond the target. I started off the first day with two hits. I felt great.</p>
<p>Then the teacher came, had a look at my technique, and pointed out flaws both in my equipment and my technique. Being an rookie, this didn’t come as a surprise. What came as a surprise was that the corrections Mori gave me were initially incredibly frustrating. My accuracy dropped sharply most of my arrows went far astray. This dragged on for most of the second training day and got extremely frustrating. My shooting had become worse.</p>
<p>Though getting a little bit better, that also dragged on for the third day. Despite focusing hard on my tasks and also being sure that they were all better then before, the result was worse then before. But suddenly, after taking some time to examine everything again in front of the Makiwara, I returned back to the shooting range to find that suddenly, things had improved. While I’m still obviously a rookie archer, suddenly, arrows were flying towards the mato at much higher accuracy.</p>
<p>Before, hitting felt like a random event in a few stray shots, after, it felt like a willful act.</p>
<p>I think the moral in there is that when improving skills for the long term, you need to be prepared for a short-term regression.</p>
