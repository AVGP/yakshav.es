<h1 id="my-personal-rust-2017-retrospective">My personal Rust 2017 retrospective</h1>
<p>I noticed recently that 2017 was such an active year in Rust for me that I feel like I want to note stuff down. Especially my community work rarely leaves lasting artifacts, so noting them down makes is an attempt to make it.</p>
<h2 id="rust-hack-learn-berlin">Rust Hack &amp; Learn Berlin</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a downending. Because of my work involvement, I haven’t visited and managed the Rust Hack &amp; Learn Berlin as much as I wanted.</p>
<p>I’ll try to do that more this year ;).</p>
<h2 id="rustfest-kyiv-zurich">RustFest Kyiv &amp; Zurich</h2>
<p>RustFest is growing nicely and I’ve been involved. Even though I can claim to have started RustFest, speaking about them in those terms is always hard: none of them would have worked without the local teams, which all have their own ways of doing things and are so great at organising stuff.</p>
<p>I was very happy that we could also serve more (geographically) eastern community with the Kyiv one, travel for large crowds is still an issue.</p>
<p>RustFest teams, you rock!</p>
<p>Off to <a href="http://paris.rustfest.eu">Paris</a>, next!</p>
<h2 id="mozfest">MozFest</h2>
<p>I helped organising a table at MozFest. Response was great, a lot of people coming around to ask a lot of things. Basically, 2 days of talking…</p>
<h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>
<p>I’ve given a couple of talks this year, some of which don’t have a video :).</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Dev Roadshow Hamburg and Berlin: Rust (20 min)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUEki-o2ihA">RubyC: Potential (about Community work, touching on Rust work) (40min)</a></li>
<li>HTWG Konstanz: The Rust Community (30 min)</li>
<li>HTWG Konstanz: Concurrency and Futures (60 min)</li>
<li>GOTO Nights Berlin: An introduction to Rust (30 min)</li>
<li>Rust Hungary: An introduction to Rust (20 min planned, 40 min actual)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj8Q12DaEQ">GOTO Berlin: Why is Rust successful? (50 min)</a></li>
<li>Open Source Business Alliance: Rust (5 min)</li>
<li>Rust Oslo: Why is Rust successful? (50 min)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Most of my code ended up being experiments on my <a href="https://github.com/skade">GitHub</a>. I’m currently trying to port <a href="https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine">webmachine</a> to Rust, under the name of <a href="https://github.com/gerust/gerust">Gerust</a>, let’s see how far that goes.</p>
<p>Two projects I started and want to end over the year are <a href="https://github.com/skade/cute">cute</a>, a small book about futures, implementing a simple executor and <a href="https://github.com/skade/the-memory-is-hot-lava">“the memory is hot lava”</a>, a zero-knowledge introduction into memory using Rust and drawings.</p>
<h2 id="professionally">Professionally</h2>
<p>I’ve grown a small Rust business, giving training. I gave a total of 6 trainings with 3 days each over the last year. One of the trainings was an advanced engineer training at Mozilla. Material can be found <a href="https://github.com/skade/rust-three-days-course">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-personal-thanks">A personal thanks</h2>
<p>I’ve been really happy to work with all the individuals in the Rust team over the last year.</p>
<p>The project from the outside might sometimes feel like a rather homegenous group, but it really isn’t. This might sound weird, but I want to explicitely point out how disagreement and complaints are handled: open and assertive.</p>
