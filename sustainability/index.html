<p>tl;dr: I’m seeking personal sponsorship. See the <a href="/sponsor-skade">Sponsor Skade</a> page for details.</p>
<p>If you have been following me in some form, you might have noticed that I do have a profession and a passion. My profession is programming, my passion is programming communities. I build community structures. As a hobby. That looks like this:</p>

<p>I’m doing this - in some form or the other - almost since I have internet access. In 1999, I started being involved in a music community as a moderator. A couple of years later, during studies, I got involved in the Ruby community in a similar capacity. From there, I moved on to running small events, multiple full conferences and a non-profit. I jumped on the chance to shape a community on an international level with Rust, joining the <em>global</em> community team and starting the (accidentally) biggest Rust conference, <a href="https://rustfest.eu">RustFest</a>. I have run the on-site component of a project all-hands. I have never moved on from the Ruby community though, I’m still around and supporting where I can. If you want a current overview of my efforts, see <a href="foss-2018-log/">this years</a> and <a href="rust-2017-retrospective">last years</a> logs or my <a href="http://skade.me/profile.html">profile</a> for details. Yep, that’s more than 17 events there, not counting meetups.</p>
<p>It’s been an interesting, often enjoyable and <a href="http://skade.me/blog/2013/exhaustion.html">sometimes not enjoyable</a> ride. But I don’t intent to complain. I have chosen to be part of the <a href="https://medium.com/@mxsash/are-we-not-all-volunteer-organisers-here-and-does-it-matter-498e300e7366">conference meat grinder</a> and have had the chance to develop skills to deal with that. I have also developed a huge set of skills around FOSS conferencing.</p>
<p>But I’m at a fork again: my project responsibilites have grown so much that they tend to take over other parts of my life. This includes time I should spend with company, clients and personal live. It leaves me with two options: shed quite some of my projects (as <a href="https://medium.com/@mxsash/are-we-not-all-volunteer-organisers-here-and-does-it-matter-498e300e7366">mxsash does</a>) or find ways of making all this more sustainable. Retreating would also mean letting <em>other</em> having to cover that, should projects survive, with less of skills.</p>
<h2 id="on-not-going-professional">On not going professional</h2>
<p>I’m frequently asked why I don’t go professional with my work. While this is certainly possible (<a href="http://event.asquera.de/">and you can even hire me throug asquera Event</a>), this is a different thing. Doing community organisation for clients or fully for a company means that you are in some way bound to them: you have to represent them, their values and their products.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t want to quit my main job: building software and working on my software company. It’s enjoyable and teasing, I like <a href="http://asquera.de/">the main asquera and its colleagues</a>. There’s no intention to leave it. Indeed, a current problem is that my involvement in community often ends up to be at asqueras cost, with no clear return. Many people believe that community contacts monetise well, but this is not necessarily the case, except when you practise <em>community sales</em>, which I don’t. Also asquera is a regular sponsor of community spaces like <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up</a>, it’s more of a cost factor.</p>
<p>My style of projects (I prefer affortability over everything) also doesn’t fit many commercial endeavours.No shiny stages here.</p>
<h2 id="professionalised-side-efforts">Professionalised side efforts</h2>
<p>Still, my efforts have grown to be a little side job. And that captures it well: many of the things I do <em>could</em> be done with a very overseeable amount of effort. But also, over the years, the expectations in quality and reliability have outgrown a hobby. Also, more and more projects approach me for consultation, which is an unpredictable effort.</p>
<p>I’m not opposed to that. I <em>like</em> building structures, I just don’t want it to be everything I spend my time with.</p>
<h2 id="room-to-breathe">Room to breathe</h2>
<p>What’s currently lacking is room to breathe. Many of my projects suffer from the fact that I need to squeeze them in. Most notably, the room to improve them is lacking. This leads to a sitation where success becomes your enemy: <a href="https://paris.rustfest.eu">RustFest Paris</a> exceeded our projections to the point where the attached <a href="https://paris.rustfest.eu/about_impl_days/">hackfest impl days</a> is a small conference in itself.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-sponsorship">Seeking sponsorship</h2>
<p>For the reasons layed out above, I’m seeking personal sponsorship. My work is valuable to communities and builds foundations. While it may not be of <em>immediate</em> use to many, it is of <em>secondary</em> use. You’re searching for Rust developer or a Rust job? RustFest has them. <a href="https://eurucamp.org">eurucamp</a> was a large hiring pool form many companies. It was innovative and raised standards of inclusiveness and accessibility. Even less direct, growing communities open up new opportunities for new people and products to raise to the top.</p>
<p>I’m seeking this sponsorship from companies (or business individuals) who benefit from my work. I don’t want money from individual donors.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="sponsor-skade">Sponsor Skade</a> page for details.</p>
<h2 id="couldnt-mozilla-pay-all-that">Couldn’t Mozilla pay all that?</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: given my involvement, couldn’t Mozilla pay me a little? It probably a question one could ask, but I currently don’t want to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mozilla already sponsors my work:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>through the awesome <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers">Mozilla TechSpeakers</a> program</li>
<li>through sponsoring people that are directly on my teams</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Mozilla can’t be the default sponsor for everything</li>
<li>I do notable work outside of Rust and help other communities out</li>
</ol>
